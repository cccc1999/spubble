Spubble is a mobile app aimed at assisting those with verbal communication issues. It is more than just your standard augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app, however. Spubble lets users build complete phrases with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

To speak a word, simply tap it. To build a phrase, just drag the word icons into the speech bubble, and tap play to hear it. To remove icons from the phrase, just drag them out of the speech bubble.

Every one of the icons that Spubble utilizes is individually designed by our amazing graphic designer. Each one is bright, colorful and dually-identifiable (text and image).
